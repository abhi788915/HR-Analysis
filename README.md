HR Analysis: Employee Attrition Prediction  In this project, I analyzed employee attrition data to uncover trends and key factors leading to employee turnover. The process involved two stages:
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation in Excel
2. Dashboard Creation in Power BI

This analysis helped the company predict and reduce employee turnover, saving on recruitment and training costs while improving employee satisfaction.
